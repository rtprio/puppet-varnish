module Puppet::Parser::Functions
  newfunction(:normalize_storage_spec, type: :rvalue, doc: <<-'ENDHEREDOC') do |args|
      Normalizes the storage specification, adjusting sizes to match the size
      format requirements of varnish.

      Examples:
        # Assumed facts:
        #  memorysize_mb: 10240.0
        #  mountpoint_a_path: /var/lib/varnish
        #  mountpoint_a_size: 8589934592 # 8 GB

        normalize_storage_spec('malloc,10%')
        # => malloc,1g

        normalize_storage_spec('file,/var/lib/varnish,10%')
        # => malloc,
    ENDHEREDOC

    if args.length != 1
      fail Puppet::ParseError.new("normalize_storage_spec(): expected 1 argument but found #{args.length}.")
    end

    begin
      return Varnish::StorageSpec.new(self, args.first).to_s
    rescue Varnish::Error => e
      fail Puppet::ParseError, "validate_storage_spec(): #{e.message}"
    end
