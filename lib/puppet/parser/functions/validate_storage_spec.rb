module Puppet::Parser::Functions
  newfunction(:validate_storage_spec, :doc => <<-'ENDHEREDOC') do |args|
    Perform validation of a varnish storage specification, ensuring that it
    it is valid for any of the three possible storage types (malloc, file or persistent)

    The following strings will validate:

        validate_storage_spec('malloc,1G')
        validate_storage_spec('file,/var/tmp,20G,16k')
        validate_storage_spec('persistent,/var/tmp,20G')

    The following strings will fail to validate, causing compilation to abort:

        validate_storage_spec('foo,1G')
        validate_storage_spec('file,var/tmp,1G')
        validate_storage_spec('persistent,/var/tmp,1.2G')
    ENDHEREDOC

    if args.length != 1
      fail Puppet::ParseError.new("validate_storage_spec(): expected 1 argument but found #{args.length}.")
    end

    begin
      Varnish::StorageSpec.new(self, args.first)
    rescue Varnish::Error => e
      fail Puppet::ParseError, "validate_storage_spec(): #{e.message}"
    end
  end
end
